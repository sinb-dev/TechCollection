## TechCollection
This is a repository containing data structure implementation challenge. Each data structure must be implemented without using native C# collections. Practicing these implementations contributes to overall coding experience and helps the developer become more agnostic in choosing and working with different programmering languages

## Challenge 1

Implement the StringList class. 

## Challenge 2
Implement the List class. This is similar to the StringList. However the list class operates in objects rather than strings alone.

## Challenge 3
Implement the Stack class

## Challenge 4
Implement the Queue class
